# Course Material the Udemy course Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations, and More!

This repo contains 3 projects, Natours, Trillo and Nexter. The course provided a starter and a final version, with the starter folder being as good as empty. Over the course of the course, I added to the starter code to resemble the final project. The design, setup, etc., etc. are the work of the course instructor, not mine. The skills, however, have been transferred.
